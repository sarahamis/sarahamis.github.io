<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning, a 
<a href="https://www.swgc.org/">Wenner-Gren Fellow</a> and a  
<a href="https://beijerstiftelsen.se/en/partners/the-beijer-laboratory-ai-research">Beijer Researcher</a> at 
<a href="https://www.uu.se/en">Uppsala University</a>. 
My research focuses on developing mathematical, statistical and computational methods to understand and predict cancer dynamics. 
I am spearheading the 
<a href="https://sarahamis.github.io/group/">Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics for Oncology (AIMOn)</a> 
research group. 
</p>

<p>
I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of St Andrews (Scotland), Tampere University (Finland) and the University of Jyväskylä (Finland). I hold a PhD in Mathematics from Swansea University (Wales) awarded year 2020.
