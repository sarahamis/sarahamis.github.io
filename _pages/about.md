I am a Wenner-Gren Fellow. 
My research focuses on developing mathematical, statistical and computational methods to understand and predict cancer dynamics. 
I previously worked at the University of St Andrews (Scotland), Tampere University and the University of Jyväskylä (Finland), and Swansea University (Wales).
