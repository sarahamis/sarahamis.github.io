<p>
I am an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning and a 
<a href="https://www.swgc.org/">Wenner-Gren Fellow</a>  
at the 
<a href="https://beijerstiftelsen.se/en/partners/the-beijer-laboratory-ai-research">Beijer Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. 
My research focuses on developing mathematical, statistical and computational methods to understand and predict cancer dynamics. 
I am spearheading the 
<a href="https://sarahamis.github.io/group/">Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics for Oncology (AIMOn)</a> 
research group at Uppsala University. 
</p>

<p>
I previously worked as a researcher at the University of St Andrews (Scotland), Tampere University and the University of Jyväskylä (Finland), and Swansea University (Wales).
