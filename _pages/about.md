at the 
<a href="https://beijerstiftelsen.se/en/partners/the-beijer-laboratory-ai-research">Beijer Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. 
My research focuses on developing mathematical, statistical and computational methods to understand and predict cancer dynamics. 
I am spearheading the 
<a href="https://sarahamis.github.io/group/">Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics for Oncology (__AIMOn__)</a> 
research group at Uppsala University.
