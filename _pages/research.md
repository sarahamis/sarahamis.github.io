I am a mathematician who studies cancer. 
My research focuses on developing mathematical, statistical and computational methods to understand and predict cancer dynamics. 
A selection of research topics that drive my research and the <a href="https://sarahamis.github.io/group/">AIMOn group</a are listed below.

# <span style="color:blue">Quantifying cell-to-cell interactions</span>
Cancer cells interact with each other. We develop mathematical models and Bayesian inference methods to quantify cell-to-cell interactions from cell imaging data. We also evaluate the role that these interactions play in therapy resistance and disease progression. 

# <span style="color:blue">Estimating biomarker dynamics</span>
Blood-based biomarkers can be used to indicate cancer severity in patients. To improve the predictive abilities of dynamical biomarker models, we develop computational and statistical parameter estimation methods that are designed to handle bio-medical data.

# <span style="color:blue">Investigating drug resistance</span>
Drug resistance is a major problem in cancer treatment. We aim to better understand when and why cancer cells (and tumours) become drug resistant. To do this, we use a variety of different modelling methods to study drug resistance on molecular, cellular and tissue-level scales. 

# <span style="color:blue">Developing Mathematical Oncology tools</span>
Mathematical Oncology is a multidisciplinary research field. We develop computational tools, tutorials and educational materials that simplify mathematical oncology practices for researchers and students from various educational backgrounds.
